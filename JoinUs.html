                    We are always looking for new members to join our team! Don't worry, you don't have to know how to ski in order to join. We can teach you! And there are support staff positions as well including tow boat driving, safety boat driving, announcing, stage and dock personnel, and concessions. It is a great way to spend the summer!<br><br>


    Our schedule during the summer is Sunday through Wednesday from 5pm - sunset at Lake Altoona Beach. Early in the season (starting the 2nd Monday in May) they are all practices. Then, starting in early June, Sunday and Wednesday are show nights and Monday and Tuesday are practices. You aren't required to attend every practice, it varies depending on what acts you are in or building towards. Also, smaller groups will occasionally meet at Riverview Park Boat Landing for extra ski time on the Chippewa River.<br><br>


    You can join the team at any time throughout the year as we also have a few gym practices during the winter and spring as well as our extraordinary Haunted House fundraiser in the Fall. Simply stop by and introduce yourself or send us a note to find out more.
